# InnoloftAssignment

Used Clean architecture for this solution
No need to for migration it will be done automatically by code 
in app config include connection string as
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "dbContext": "USER ID=postgres;Password=7upyours;Server=localhost;port=5432;Database=Innoloft;"
  } 
  Used postgresql for Entity framework and used Code first approach
  
  Added attachment in Innoloft_Response Folder
  added postman collection
  Note:
  for testing singin as new user and login since i have included authentication service for users
